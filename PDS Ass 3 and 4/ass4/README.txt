#Here are the findings based on the output:

a) Comparison of Glucose Statistics between Sample and Population:

Mean Glucose value:
Sample: 121.69 mg/dL
Population: 121.69 mg/dL
Maximum Glucose value:
Sample: 199 mg/dL
Population: 199 mg/dL
The mean and maximum glucose values of the sample closely match those of the population, indicating that the sample is representative.
b) Comparison of 98th Percentile BMI between Sample and Population:

98th Percentile BMI:
Sample: 47.40
Population: 47.88
The 98th percentile BMI of the sample is slightly lower than that of the population, suggesting that the sample may have a slightly lower maximum BMI.
c) Comparison of Bootstrap Statistics for BloodPressure with Population Statistics:

Population Mean BloodPressure: 72.40 mmHg
Population Standard Deviation BloodPressure: 12.37 mmHg
Population 95th Percentile BloodPressure: 91.70 mmHg
The histograms show the distribution of bootstrap means, standard deviations, and 95th percentiles of BloodPressure compared to the population statistics. The bootstrap statistics closely resemble the population statistics, indicating that the bootstrap samples are representative of the population.
Overall, the sample and bootstrap statistics closely align with the population statistics, suggesting that the sample and bootstrap samples are representative of the population.
